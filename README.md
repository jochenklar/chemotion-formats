chemotion-formats
=================

Experimental scripts to work on semantic formats for [Chemotion ELN](https://chemotion.net).

`jcampdx2jsonld.py` converts a JCAMPDX 5.0 (not 6.0) into a JSONLD. The details are in `utils/jcampdx.json`.

`dataklass2jsonld.py` converts a (fake) data file to a JSONLD with the help of a (patched) Chemotion `dataklass` file. Details are in `utils/dataklass.py`.
